Each repository may contain one or more packages. When a repository contains
two or more packages, it is expected that all packages' versions within the same
repository get updated together. Git will tag them all simultaneously.

Continuous integration
----------------------

Each repository in the workspace contains a few jobs that run under the
following circumstances:

* On a push event: the last commit of branch compiles and runs the package
  tests with ``gcc`` and ``ld``.
* On a pull request event: ``gcc`` build and tests will be executed. ``clang``
  build, sanitizers and static analyzer will be triggered using specific labels
  in the pull request:

  * ``do-clang-test`` executes ``clang`` build and test, ``asan``, ``ubsan``
    and ``tsan`` (when enabled) build and test.
  * ``do-static-analyzer-test`` executes ``scan-build`` in the project.
* Scheduled job: there are two types of scheduled jobs. One that runs every
  night and executes a full build and test of the entire workspace with
  ``gcc``. Another weekly event runs also the sanitizers and static analyzer.
  Every night, a tarball with a full build is generated as a way to have
  snapshots of the workspace binaries.

See `Compiler support`_ for more details.

Coding standards
================

Languages
---------

C++ programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workspace uses C++ 17 and each package should compile with ``gcc`` and
``clang`` (see `Compiler support`_ for more details).

The workspace follows `Drake style guide`_ which is a derivative of
`Google style guide`_.

Exceptions:

* `Line length`_: is modified to 120 columns to better fit the modern and wider
  screens.

.. _Drake style guide: https://drake.mit.edu/styleguide/cppguide.html
.. _Google style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
.. _Line length: https://drake.mit.edu/styleguide/cppguide.html#Line_Length


Python programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code is formatted following PEP8.

CMake programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake is the underlying build system tool and language, it is treated as a first
class citizen like C++ and Python. For that reason, the following general
conventions must be followed on top of `ROS2 CMake conventions`_.

.. _ROS2 CMake conventions: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions/#cmake

Libraries
"""""""""

* All libraries should be ``SHARED`` libraries. Consider using
  ``set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS true)`` in your top level CMakeLists.txt file.
* Libraries should not include in their target name the project name unless they
  are the main library in the package. We don't expect to have as target names
  ``maliput_foo`` for the ``foo`` functionality.
* Use namespaces the following way: ``project_name\:\:library_name`` as follows:

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:

    add_library(maliput::foo ALIAS foo)

* Use ``_`` instead of ``-`` in compound names.
* Include in the binary name the project name:

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:

    set_target_properties(foo
      PROPERTIES
        OUTPUT_NAME maliput_foo
    )

* General ``install()`` commands are expected as follows:

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:

    install(
      TARGETS foo
      EXPORT ${PROJECT_NAME}-targets
      ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
      LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
      RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
    )

* Use ``ament_export_libraries(my_custom_library)``.
* Consider using the generation expressions for target_include_directories
  within the project:

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:

    target_include_directories(foo
      PUBLIC
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
        $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
    )

* Header file only libraries should be created as interfaces and header files
  must be placed in the include directory at the top level of the package. Make
  sure to install those header files later on. The target name is superfluous
  because those files will be discoverable by the consuming target if paths are
  properly set. However, the decision is to add another layer of security at the
  target level.

* When using the maliput plugin architecture system, if shared library and executable
  are compiled using `ubsan`(undefined behavior sanitizer) the property `ENABLE_EXPORTS`
  should be enabled on the executable target in order to instruct the linker to add
  all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.
  For further information see next `reference link`_.

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:

    set_target_properties(foo
      PROPERTIES
        ENABLE_EXPORTS ON
    )

.. _reference link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57361776/use-ubsan-with-dynamically-loaded-shared-libraries


Executables
"""""""""""

* Use ``_`` instead of ``-`` in compound names.
* ``install()`` commands are expected as follows:

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:

    install(foo
      EXPORT ${PROJECT_NAME}-targets
      ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
      LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
      RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
    )

Resources
"""""""""

* Define a project resources path and install resources following your structure
  within ``share/project_name/resources`` folder in the install space.

Testing
-------

* 100% coverage of the public API of any entity must be unit-tested.
* Complex pieces of code that are not exposed should be considered to be
  re-engineered in favor of increased coverage.
* Integration test between modules can be done when appropriate.
* Consider using ``maliput_integration_tests`` for complex integration tests.
* ``gtest`` and ``gmock`` via `ament_cmake`_ packages are the default testing
  frameworks for C++.
* ``python3-pytest`` via `ament_cmake`_ packages is the default testing
  frameworks for Python.

.. _ament_cmake: https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake


Linting
-------

``ament_clang_format`` alone cannot be used because we have a custom format. So
packages hold a tools folder at the root level in which a script called
``reformat_code.sh`` calls the previous tool with the custom package.

For Python code, make sure to use `ament cmake flake8`_. To do so, you should
follow the `instructions here`_ and use one of the ``.flake8`` files in your
package root directory to tell the linter which are the tests you want to
perform. In particular, we edit it so it has the following extras:

.. code-block:: RST
    :linenos:

    # Set the maximum length that any line (with some exceptions) may be.
    max-line-length = 100
    # Set the maximum allowed McCabe complexity value for a block of code.
    max-complexity = 10
    # Toggle whether pycodestyle should enforce matching the indentation of the opening bracketâ€™s line.
    # incluences E131 and E133
    hang-closing = True
    # Specify a list of codes to ignore.
    ignore =
        E133,
        E226,
    # Specify the list of error codes you wish Flake8 to report.
    select =
      E,
      W,
      F,
      C

.. _instructions here: https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/blob/master/ament_cmake_flake8/doc/index.rst


Supported OSs and environments
------------------------------

The workspace is only maintained on Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS2 Dashing.

Compiler support
----------------

The workspace is built with Ubuntu's default ``gcc`` (version 7.5) and ``ld``
(version 2.30) and ``clang`` and ``llvm`` tools (version 8).

* Address sanitizer
* Undefined behavior sanitizer.
* Thread sanitizer.
* Static analyzer (scan-build): it runs with ``clang``.

Versioning
==========

``maliput`` packages adhere to `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ and
will follow as much as possible the `ROS2 Versioning guidelines <https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#versioning>`_ .


Branches and tags for releases
------------------------------

The following branches and tags schemes will be used:

* Use ``main`` as the mainline development branch. The tip of
  that branch will be the latest development state. It is not safe.
  Downstream projects are encouraged to avoid using it unless there is a
  business need to do so.
* Each repository will have branches with the following pattern:
  ``release/major.minor.x``, e.g. ``release/1.2.x``. Each patch release ``(x)``
  will contain one or more additional bug fix commits relative to the previous
  patch release ``(x - 1)``.

Releases
========

Named major releases
--------------------

Significant releases of Maliput packages will be named. The names will
be chosen based on famous roads and will be alphabetically sorted. Significant
releases will be created on demand.

Major release output
--------------------

Every new major release will provide:

- Updated ``maliput_rolling.repos`` file when appropriate (new major release,
  update to latest minor release or patch release).
- New ``maliput_<name>.repos`` file.
- Updated tarball in S3 bucket with the following name pattern: ``maliput_ws_<name>_YYYYMMDD_bionic.tar.gz``
  where ``name`` is the release name and ``YYYYMMDD`` is the release date (see
  :ref:`create-a-named-release-tarball` ).


How to release?
---------------

There are different steps to follow based on the type of release you want to
create.

Make a new major ``maliput`` workspace release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Choose a name that is next in the alphabet relative to the previous major
  release.
* Prepare the workspace by pinning all dependencies and downstream packages to
  their target branches or tags.
* Build and test the workspace with all packages pointing to their pinned
  versions.
* Update ``maliput_rolling.repos`` file in `repos_index <https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/repos_index>`_
  under the appropriate ROS2 distro folder.
* Create a new ``maliput_<name>.repos`` file in `repos_index <https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/repos_index>`_
  under the appropriate ROS2 distro folder.
* Create a binary tarball of the workspace (see :ref:`create-a-named-release-tarball`).
* Upload the binary tarball to Amazon S3 bucket.

Create a new package major release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Prepare the workspace by pinning all dependencies and downstream packages to
  their target branches or tags.
* Prepare the release branch:

  * Update the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``package.xml`` files via a PR targeting
    ``main``.
  * From ``main`` branch, create a new branch called
    ``release/major.minor.x``. ``x`` is not a placeholder, it is the literal
    **x** because this branch will contain all the potential future patch
    releases in the series of ``major.minor.0``, ``major.minor.1`` and so on (e.g.
    `1.3.0`, `1.3.1`, `1.3.2`, etc.). A tag will be used to name the specific
    commit in the branch.
  * Run **all** tests. If you encounter any problem, send PRs to fix them
    targeting ``main`` branch. Merge those commits into
    ``release/major.minor.x``.
* Push the branch.
* Make a tag with the appropriate version number: ``release/major.minor.0``.
* Push the tag.
* Create a PR to `repos_index <https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/repos_index>`_
  and update ``maliput_rolling.repos`` to indicate the branch name
  ``release/major.minor.x`` as the latest package version.

Create a new package minor release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Prepare the workspace by pinning all dependencies and downstream packages to
  their target branches or tags.
* Prepare the release branch:

  * From the tip of ``release/major.[minor - 1].x``, create a new branch called
    ``release/major.minor.x``.
  * Push the branch ``release/major.minor.x``.
  * Cherry-pick commits as needed from ``main`` and include them into
    ``release/major.minor.x`` via PRs. Alternatively, create feature branches
    whose PRs target ``release/major.minor.x``.
  * Update the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``package.xml`` via a PR targeting
    ``release/major.minor.x``.
  * Run **all** tests. If you encounter any problem, send PRs to fix them
    targeting ``release/major.minor.x`` branch.
* Make a tag with the appropriate version number: ``release/major.minor.0``.
* Push the tag.
* When the ``major`` and ``minor`` version numbers are the greatest: create a PR
  to `repos_index <https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/repos_index>`_
  and update ``maliput_rolling.repos`` to indicate the branch name
  ``release/major.minor.x`` as the latest package version.
* Consider updating the affected named  ``maliput`` workspace releases.

Create a new package patch release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Prepare the workspace by pinning all dependencies and downstream packages to
  their target branches or tags.
* Prepare the release branch:

  * Cherry-pick commits as needed from ``main`` and include them into
    ``release/major.minor.x`` via PRs. Alternatively, create feature branches
    whose PRs target ``release/major.minor.x``.
  * Update the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``package.xml`` via a PR targeting
    ``release/major.minor.x``.
  * Run **all** tests. If you encounter any problem, send PRs to fix them
    targeting ``release/major.minor.x`` branch.
* Make a tag with the appropriate version number: ``release/major.minor.patch``.
* Push the tag.
* Consider updating the affected named ``maliput`` workspace release.

Create a named release tarball
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate the tarball:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd /path/to/maliput_ws
    export BUNDLE_NAME=maliput_ws_name
    mv install ${BUNDLE_NAME};
    CURRENT_BUNDLE_TARBALL_NAME="${BUNDLE_NAME}_$(date +%Y%m%d)_bionic.tar.gz"
    tar -czvf ${CURRENT_BUNDLE_TARBALL_NAME} ${BUNDLE_NAME}
